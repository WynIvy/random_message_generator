    {id: 1, quote: `The First, is to observe what it is that moves a person to propose or ask a question of an Astrologer; where we must take notice of three motions: the First, of the mind, when a man is stirred up in his thoughts and hath an intent to enquire; a Second, of the superior and celestial bodies; so that they at that time imprint on the thing enquired after, what shall become of it; the Third, of the free will which disposes him to the very act of enquiring; for although the mind be moved to enquire, 'tis not enough, unless the superior bodies sympathize therewith; nor is such motion of the stars enough, unless by the election of his will the person does actually enquire.`},
    {id: 2, quote: `The Second consideration is (what we hinted at before) the method or manner everyone ought to observe that enquires of an Astrologer; which is, that when he intends to take an artist’s judgment of things past, present, or to come, he should, first, with a devout spirit, pray unto the Lord, from whom proceeds the success of every lawful enterprise, that he would grant him the knowledge of those things of the truth of which he would be resolved; and then let him apply himself to the astrologer with a serious intent of being satisfied in some certain and particular doubt, and this not on trifling occasions, or light sudden emotions, much less in matters base or unlawful, as many ignorant people used to do; but in matters of honest importance, and such as have possessed and disturbed his mind for the space of a day and night or longer; unless in sudden accidents which admit not of delay.`},
    {id: 3, quote: `The Third, is to consider how many ways Planets operate upon Inferior Bodies according to the divers Qualities of their motions: there being Sixteen different ways of such their operations and effects in all things that are either wholly or in part perfected or destroyed.`},
    {id: 4, quote: `The Fourth, is to consider particularly these several Sixteen ways, and what are the assisting causes that help forward things to perfection, and what there are that destroy things after they are perfected. <Br>Now of these the first is Profection, or an advance of or in, things, which the philosophers call ‘Alchecohol.’<br>2. Detriment, which they call ‘Aliber.’ <br>3. Conjunction or Reversion, which they call ‘Alitifall.’ <br>4. Separation, which they call ‘Alnichirat.’<br>5. Translation of light, which they call ‘Annecad.’ <br>6. Collection, which they call ‘Algemei.’ <br>7. Prohibition, which they call ‘Almana.’ <br>8. Reception, called ‘Alcobol.’ <br>9. Being void of course, called ‘Gastalcobal.’ <br>10. Permission, called   ‘Galaalocir.’ <br>11. The restoring or giving of virtue or disposition, called ‘Alteat.’ <br>12. The withdrawing of virtue, called ‘Dalpha Alchoa.’ <br>13. The withdrawer or driver away of disposition, called ‘Daffaredbit.’ <br>14. Fortitude, ‘Alcoevah.’ <br>15. Debility, ‘Adirof.’ <br>The 16th is the state of the Moon called ‘Gnaymel,’ or the Moon ill-affected; which the ancients generally hold to be of ill signification.`},
    {id: 5, quote: `The Fifth, is to consider, how many ways the Moon comes to be so ill-affected, which are generally reckoned to be Ten, but in my opinion Seven more may be added, whereby hindrances and damage happen in all Questions, Nativities, Elections, and actions whatsoever; the First is, where the Moon is combust, that is to say under the Sun’s Beams, which is counted from 15 degrees of the body of the Sun as she applies to him to 12 degrees distance from him as she is separating from him; and the impediment is greater when she is going to the Sun than when she is going from him; because as she goes off, when she is got five degrees distant, she is said to be escaped, though not wholly freed. As when a fever hath left a man, he is said to be recovered, although he be weak and faint, because he is secure now that he shall obtain his health again. The 2nd is when she is in the degrees of her descensions, that is in the 3rd degree of Scorpio, or in any part of Scorpio or Capricorn or injoined with any planet that is in her or its own descensions, as if she be joined with the Sun, who is in Scorpio or Capricorn or in in his proper descension, viz., in Aquary or Libra, viz., in its 19th degree or in any part of Libra; or should be joined with Mars, and he be in Libra or Taurus, or in the 28th degree, or in any part of Cancer; and so with any other Planet or Planets respectively. The 3rd is when she is posited in any of the combust degrees, of which the worst are: those 12 degrees which are before the degree which is directly opposite to the degree in which the Sun is, wherever she shall happen to be, The 4th is when she is in conjunction, opposition, or square to either of the Infortunes, Saturn or Mars, without a perfect reception; for with one it hinders but little, but in all other places ‘tis a grand impediment, both in the said aspect and also in corporal conjunction save only where the Infortune shall have two of his smaller dignities, as with Saturn in the 4 last degrees of Aries or Gemini, in each of which he has a Term and a Triplicity; or with Mars in the last 10 degrees of Pisces, where he has a Face and a Triplicity; and so in any other sign or place. The 5th is when she is with the Dragon’s Head or with the Dragon's Tail, that is, within twelve degrees of either of them, because that is the place where she is eclipsed. The 6th is when she is in Gemini, which is the twelfth from her own House. The 7th is when she is in the end of Signs, which are all Terms of the Infortunes, except the last 6 degrees of Leo, which belong to Jupiter; but in the first eight she is weakened because they are the Terms of Saturn. If it be objected by the same reason she must be impedited likewise in the first 6 degrees of Cancer, since they are terms of Mars, I answer no, because Cancer is her own House and greatest Fortitude. The 8th is when she is in the 6th, 8th, 9th or 12th Houses (not in reception with the Ascendant), or joined to any Planet that is in any of them or posited in the Third House, because it is cadent from angles; yet because the same is said to be her joy (or that she delights therein), she is not afflicted there so much as in other Cadent Houses. The 9th is when she is between the 15th degree of Libra and the 15th degree of Scorpio, which 30 degrees are called Combust Way. The 10th when she is void of course, that is, not joined to any planet by body or aspect, or in that condition when they call her Feral or Desart, that is, in a place where she has not any dignity. The 11th when she is slow of course, because then she may be compared to a Planet Retrograde. The 12th when she is in want of light, so that no part or very little of her is seen, which happens about the end of the lunar month. The 13th when she is besieged by the two Infortunes impediting her. The 14th if she be in Azimene degrees. The 15th if in Pitted degrees. The 16th if in Smoky Degrees. The 17th and last is when she is posited in those degrees which are called Dark. To know and distinguish all which you have Tables commonly in most Books of Astrology`},
    {id: 6, quote: `The Sixth Consideration, is to regard another manner whereby planets are debilitated or weakened and afflicted, not much different from the former, which comes to pass Ten ways. <br>The 1st, when a planet is Cadent from Angles or from the Ascendant, so that he does not behold the same. <br>The 2nd, when the Planet is Retrograde. <br>The 3rd, if they be combust, that is, within 15 degrees before or after the Sun; the lower Planets are more debilitated, being behind the Sun, and the less before him, when they are direct; but when retrograde the contrary. <br>4. When any of them is in Opposition, Corporal Conjunction, or Square of either or both the Infortunes without Reception. <br>5. When they are besieged by the Infortunes, so as to separate from one and be joined to another, without perfect reception of House, Exaltation, or two of the smaller Dignities, which are Term, Triplicity and Face. <br>When a Planet is joined to another in his Declension or Fall, that is, in Opposition to its own House or Exaltation. <br>7. When it is joined to a Planet Cadent from the Ascendant, or separates from a Planet that did receive him, and is joined to another that doth not. <br>8. When a Planet is Peregrine, that is, in a place where he hath not any Dignity; or being one of the Superiors is followed by the Sun, or being of the Inferiors when it follows the Sun. <br>9. When a Planet is with the Head or Tail of the Dragon, without Latitude. <br>10. When a planet weakens itself, that it, when it is in the seventh house from its own, Feral, or not in Reception. <br>These are the Impediments of the Planets, that cause Hindrances, delays, and mischiefs in Nativities, Questions, Elections, etc.; all which thou oughtest to be well acquainted with. There are some more that seem necessary to be known, but to avoid tediousness and confusion I shall at present omit them.`},
    {id: 7, quote: `The Seventh Consideration, is to beware of those cases wherein the Astrologer is subject to err and mistake; of which the learned have named four: 1. When the Querent is so silly that he knows not how to ask, nor what he would have. 2. When the time for which the figure is erected is mistaken. 3. When the Artist knows not whether the Sun be gone off the line of the Mid-Heaven, or still upon it: or be behind or before it. 4. When the Fortunes and Infortunes shall be of equal strength; at which time thou therefore oughtest not to receive any question. But, in my opinion, there may well be added yet three ways more, wherein the Astrologer will subject to err: 1. When the Querent comes only to try him, or put a trick upon him, as many do, saying, ‘Let us go to such an Astrologer, and ask him such a thing, and see if he can tell us the truth or not.’ Just as the Jews propounded questions to our Lord Jesus Christ, not so much to be resolved, as to tempt and ensnare Him. 2. Wherein the Artist will be liable to err, is when the Querent does not ask out of a serious or settled intention, as some do when they meet an Astrologer by chance or go to him on other business: on a sudden they think of something, and so ask, as it were by-the-bye; wherein ‘tis a thousand to one but mistakes happen. But thou mayest be ready to say, ‘How shall I know whether the Querent come out of a solid intention, or only to try me?’ To which I answer, that it seems a very abstruse and difficult point, perfectly to find out; but this I have often experienced and found true, viz., I observed the hour of the Question, and if the Ascendant then happened very near the end of one sign and beginning of another, so that it seemed as between both; I said they did not ask seriously, or that they came to try me; and I have had many that have thereupon confessed what I said to be true, and began to think that I knew more than before they believed. For in such cases I used to say, ‘Pray, friend, do not trouble me unless you ask seriously, for I suspect that you would put a trick upon me, by not proposing this Question as you ought: however, if you will give me trouble for your pleasure, be pleased to give me likewise satisfaction for my pains’; and immediately, if there were any deceit intended, away they went. Another, viz., a third way whereby an Astrologer may err, is when the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the Hour are not the same, nor of the same Triplicity, or be not of the same Complexion with the Ascendant; for then the Question is not Radical, as I have frequently found by experience. And this I have recited, that thou may’st know for what persons thou should’st undertake to give judgment; for as one says, “The issue of the thing is according to the solicitude of the Querent, and as he comes in necessity, as sad, thoughtful, and hoping that thou art able and knowest how to satisfy him the truth of the matter; and in such cases thou may’st securely venture upon the question.”`},
    {id: 8, quote: `The Eighth Consideration is, To mind how many of the aforesaid manners or points necessary to be used and heeded in giving Judgments thou hast to consider; and they are Thirty, that is to say, sixteen impediments of the Moon, ten of the other Planets; as hath been said, and besides all those the Planets’ several joys, which are four. Of which the first is the House which each Planet does delight in, as Mercury in the Ascendant, the Moon in the Third, Venus in the fifth, Mars in the sixth, the Sun in the ninth, Jupiter in the eleventh, Saturn in the Twelfth. The second is, when a Planet is in a sign he delights in, as Saturn in Aquarius, Jupiter in Sagittary, Mars in Scorpio, Sol in Leo, Venus in Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, and the Moon in Cancer. The third is when Diurnal Planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Sol, and Mercury, are in Diurnal Houses in the East and Oriental of the Sun near the Horoscope; and the Nocturnal Planets, as Mars, Venus, Luna and Mercury, are in Nocturnal Houses in the West and Occidental of the Sun; especially near the cusp of the seventh. The fourth is when the three Superiors, Saturn, Jupiter or Mars, are in Masculine Quarters; which are counted from the cusp of the Tenth House to the cusp of the Ascendant, and from the cusp of the fourth House to the cusp of the seventh House; and when the Feminines, viz., Venus or the Moon are in Feminine Quarters, which are from the cusp of the Ascendant to the cusp of the fourth House and from the cusp of the seventh to the cusp of the tenth. As for Mercury, he delights when with Masculine Planets in Masculine Quarters, but with Feminine Planets in Feminine.`},
    {id: 9, quote: `The Ninth Consideration is, To take notice of the several ways, as well secret as manifest, good and evil, whereby things are helped or hindered to be done or not done, and of these there are one and twenty in number. 1. A most strong secret helper. 2. A very strong secret Helper. 3. A strong secret helper. 4. A weak secret Helper. 5. A weak secret Helper. 6. A most weak secret Helper. 7. A most strong manifest Helper. 8. A very strong manifest Helper. 9. A strong manifest Helper. 10. A weak manifest Helper. 11. A weaker manifest Helper. 12. A most weak manifest Helper. 13. A most strong secret Hinderer. I4. A very strong secret Hinderer. 15. A strong secret Hinderer. 16. A weak secret Hinderer. 17. A weaker secret Hinderer. 18. A most weak secret Hinderer. 19. A most strong manifest Hinderer. 20. A very strong manifest Hinderer; and 21. A strong manifest Hinderer. All which we shall treat particularly, the same being a secret of secrets. In the judicial part of Astrology which the ancients did not regard, nor have said anything plainly of it that I find, save only that ‘Haly’ seems to have touched a little upon it in his Exposition of the 23rd of Ptolemy’s Centiloquium; nor do I believe they omitted those things out of ignorance, but rather through disuse or fear of being too tedious, or burdening the minds of their Readers or Auditors: For they were wont to judge, according as they found the Planets disposed in Houses and Signs, their Fortitudes and Debilities, together with the Part of Fortune, and some few other things. But thou oughtest to consider in thy judgments, not only what they did, but also all other circumstances that thou canst; for when thou dost erect a figure, thou should’st first find the Significator of the thing enquired after, or to be undertaken, and see if any of the fixed stars of his own Nature be in either of his Houses, or in his Exaltation, or in conjunction with him to a minute; for then such star shall so far help the significator, that the thing shall be accomplished and effected, even beyond the Querent’s hopes, and this is a most strong secret Helper: For the Querent may well wonder how it comes to pass. Now, if the same star should be in the same degree with the Significator from one minute to 15’ before him or 5’ behind him, it will still help him, but not so much: and this we call a very strong secret Helper; but if it be with him in the same degree, but above 16 minutes distance and within 50’, it will somewhat help, yet this less; and this we call in the Positive degree only a strong secret Helper. If it be in the same degree with the Significator, in a place where he has two of his smaller Dignities, in the very same minute, or within 16 minutes, it will help him yet less, and then ‘tis a weak secret Helper; from 16’ to 50’ still less, and then ‘tis a weaker secret Helper; but if it be with the Significator in a place where he has no dignities at all it will still help, but as it were insensibly; and this we call a most weak secret helper. The like we may say on the contrary of those things that prejudice, frustrate, and hinder business: For if a Planet which is Significator of anything, being in a place where he has not any Dignities, shall be joined with one of the Fixed Stars of a contrary nature, it will weaken him and not suffer the thing to come to pass; although otherwise by the Figure it seemed never so probable; so that, for want of heeding this, the Artist often gets discredit, and raises a scandal on the Art itself amongst the ignorant: and this is a most strong secret Hinderer; whereas if the same Star be remote above 16 minutes from the Significator, it will weaken him, but not altogether so much; whence it may be called only a very strong secret Hinderer. And so downwards through all degrees in the same manner as we said of the Helpers or Assistant Causes respectively <br>Of the several 21 Modes aforesaid, which are most strong Helpers, &c. and which strongest obstructs<br> The several Modes before mentioned are thus to be known and distinguished: A most strong manifest Helper or Adjuvant cause, is when the Planet which is Significator of a thing, is in his own House; in an Angle on the very minute of the cusp, direct, swift of course, in reception, and free from all affliction and impediment; which most seldom happens.<br>A very strong manifest Helper, is when the Significator is in his House or Exaltation in an Angle within a degree or two of the Cusp, free from impediment, and in Reception, which very seldom happens. <br>A strong manifest Helper, is when the Significator is in an Angle in his House or Exaltation, within 3 degrees before the Cusp, or 5 degrees after it. <br>A weak manifest Helper, is where a Planet is in two of his lesser Dignities in an Angle within 5 degrees before or 15 degrees after it; or is in his House, or Exaltation, in a succedent House free from affliction.<br>A weaker open Helper, is when the Significator is in his own House or Exaltation, or two of his lesser Dignities, but in a cadent House of the Figure, yet beholding the Ascendant. <br>A most weak open Helper is when the Significator is in some of his greater Dignities, or two of his lesser, not beholding the Ascendant; or in one of his lesser Dignities; only beholding the same, or joined to a Planet that beholds the same, and has some Dignities therein. <br>A most strong open Hinderer is when the Significator is in a place where he hath no Dignity, no delight, is not received; besieged by the Two Infortunes, Cadent from an Angle, and from the Ascendant: and so much the worse if joined with any of the Fixed Stars, of a mischievous nature, &c. <br> There may be other both adjuvant and obstructing causes, besides what we have mentioned, both open and secret; proceeding from the conjunctions of Planets and their Aspects, too tedious here to discourse of. Nor shall I here enlarge on all those before mentioned, but most assure thee that this ninth consideration, carefully observed, will be of great use in raising a true and wary judgment; especially if thou hast always a diligent eye to the Moon; for she of all the Planets has the greatest similitude and correspondence with inferior things, both in general and particular: as well the species of the kinds as the individuals of the species; with winds; to pass by her daily effects which she causes in all things here, and frequent revolutions about the Elements and Elementary Bodies by reason of the nearness of her Orb to the Earth, and smaller circle than any other Planet; so that she seems a Mediatrix between Superior and Inferior Bodies.<br> And as we see that in the New Moon she appears small, thin, and little, but afterwards her light gradually increases, till all that part of her body towards us becomes replenished with lustre: and then again it decays by insensible degrees till she totally disappears: just so do all bodies both of things Rational, Irrational, and Vegetative: as men grow until they are completed to their determinate stature, and then droop and decline continually till their life is ended; and so of all other things. Hence tis necessary to make the Moon concerned in the Signification of every Question, Nativity, Enterprise and Business, and her good condition to show the good issue of the thing: and so on the contrary. For her Virtue and Power is such and so great, that if the Lord of the Ascendant or other Significator of a business be so weak and afflicted that he cannot bring it about and complete it as he ought: if she be but strong it shall, notwithstanding, be accomplished. For she is the School-mistress of all things; the Bringer-down of all the Planets’ influences, and a kind of an ‘internuncio’ between them, carrying their virtues from one to the other, by receiving the disposition of one planet and bearing it to another. And some have thought that she does this at all times, of which opinion was that Tyrant Cylinus de Romano, viz., That when she separates from one Planet, she takes the virtue and carries it to another, committing the same to the first that she can meet with. And some have imagined that “Zael” said the same; but his meaning was not absolutely so; for he believed That the Moon did bear what was committed to her; but if it were not so given or committed to her she could not carry anything to any; to which I assent: for when the Moon is joined to any planet that receives her, then that planet commits its disposition to her, who carries it with her and bestows it on that planet whom she first meets with in any of her dignities, and not to another: according to that Aphorism, — “A Planet gives nothing in a place, where he has promised nothing.”`},
    {id: 10, quote: `The Tenth Consideration, Is warily to observe what Fixed Stars may either help or hinder the matter in question; for they have oftentimes great power, and lead the Astrologer sometimes into error; and let the Artist be sure to consider the places of the Fixed Stars, as they are in the present age carefully reduced.`},
    {id: 11, quote: `The Eleventh Consideration, Is to take notice of the Malevolent Planets, and what they signify; for Saturn and Mars are naturally bad, Saturn for excess of cold, and Mars for excess of heat; not that either of them is really hot or cold, but virtually so; and these are their effects. And so they signify evil and damage and hindrance, unless they receive the Significator or the Moon by House, Exaltation, or two of their smaller dignities; or shall themselves be Significators; for then they will bridle in their malice, and not weaken or hinder him whom they receive, with what aspect soever they behold him; but if they do not receive, their malice is increased; and so much the more if they be in Opposition or Square; for in Sextile or Trine the mischief is less. Yet ‘Zael’ seems to say that Infortunes lay aside or restrain their malice, where they are in Trine or Sextile; but his meaning was only that they were not then so violent, and intended not that their malice was wholly abated.`},
    {id: 12, quote: `The Twelfth Consideration, Is to behold the Fortunes, and see what they signify; for Jupiter and Venus are Fortunes by Nature, and being temperate, are said to be without any malice, because they do hurt to none, unless now and then by accident; which is beside their intention and very seldom for they make their impression temperately and profitably, and always endeavour to help both their own and others, whether they receive them or not; but so much the better if they receive them; and their Trine or Sextile is better and more advantageous than their Square, and their square than their Oppositions.`},
    {id: 13, quote: `The Thirteenth Consideration, is to regard the Sun and his Significators, for he is also called a fortune, and so, whatever aspect he shall be beheld by, unless it be Opposition; but by Conjunction he becomes an Infortune, because then he renders every star that is so in Conjunction with him, combust and unfortunate; unless the same shall be in the heart of the Sun, and there every star is fortified.`},
    {id: 14, quote: `The Fourteenth Consideration is to mind Mercury and the Moon, and what Planets they are joined with; because they will have the signification with those with whom they are so joined; being of a convertible nature.`},
    {id: 15, quote: `The Fifteenth Consideration, is to regard the several ways in general whereby Planets make impressions on these inferior things, which are two, one good and the other bad; for the Fortunes have power of imprinting good naturally, and the Infortunes as naturally shower down ill impressions; whence thou mayest, wherever thou seest the Fortunes, hope for good; and when thou beholdest the Malevolents, fear mischief, unless the same be restrained as aforesaid.`},
    {id: 16, quote: `The Sixteenth Consideration is to take notice whether the Planet that is Significator of anything, be afflicted by either of the Malevolents; which is when one of them casts his rays upon the rays of such Significators, according to the quantity of their Orbs; And Whilst he so continues with his rays or light under those of the Malevolent, such Significator is said to be impedited, hindered or afflicted, till the Malevolent have passed him; and ‘Zael’ says, “After the ill Planet has passed the Planet he did afflict, one whole degree, the Planet shall be said to be freed of him.”** But I rather think that after the Malevolent is passed him one minute, he may be said to be free and excepted; ** for afterwards he can only frighten him. True it is he raises a greater fear when he is passed him only one minute, than when he is gone by a whole degree; but yet even then it is such a kind of fear as is not altogether without some glimmering of hope. As thus, One intending to go into a Battle, inquires whether he shall return from thence safe and sound or not? And the Ascendant is Gemini 13 degrees, and Mercury in the 7th degree and 54 min. of Aquary, in the 9th joined with Saturn, who is likewise in 7 degrees 53 minutes of Aquary, so that Mercury is now separated from Saturn, who was Lord of the House of Death, one minute; whence it appears that he should have died in that engagement by reason of the Conjunction, and was in peril of death and a kind of desperate fear that he should be slain by his enemies and shall be pursued by them so that shall seem not able to escape, and they shall often lay hands on him, but at last he shall get away from them and make his escape; even beyond his own hopes; and all because Mercury is separated from Saturn; and ‘Zael” saith, “That if a Malevolent planet that would hinder any business be cadent from the Ascendant so that he cannot behold it, he cannot really hinder the matters; but only puts the persons concerned into terrors and frights about it.”`},
    {id: 17, quote: `The Seventeenth Consideration, is to view whether the Planet that is Significator, be safe and prosperous, that is free from any affliction from the Infortunes; and one of the Fortunes casts his beams or light on the beams of such Significator; for then shall that Planet be said to be safe and guarded till the Fortune is passed by the space of one minute, and signifies the perfection of the thing. But after he has passed him one minute, it will not be perfected or accomplished; for it only raises hopes; as (we said) the Malevolent in the like case could do nothing, but create fear. Yet is such a hope as the Querent will believe and fancy himself as it were certain; yet not without something of doubt: as for example, A Question is proposed of some weighty and difficult business, whether it will be done and brought to pass or not? And 17 degrees of Scorpio Ascends, and Mars is 12 degrees 13 minutes of Taurus, and Venus in 12 degrees and 14 minutes of Capricorn, so that Venus is joined to Mars by a Trine, and receives him in her House, who likewise receives her in his Exaltation; so that the Querent thinks, and all others concerned verily believe, that it would be accomplished by that aspect of perfect friendship; in which flattering hopes they continue till Venus hath passed the Aspect of Mars one whole degree; but at last the business comes to just nothing at all, because Venus was past Mars one minute at the time of the question proposed: Yet may a thing possibly in such a case be brought to pass, but not without extraordinary labour and trouble. And here likewise ‘Zael’ affirms, “That if the Fortune be cadent from the Ascendant, so that it cannot behold the same, it only flatters with splendid hopes, but never completes the business.” `},
    {id: 18, quote: `The Eighteenth Consideration, Is to take notice when a planet is in the Angles of the Infortunes, for unless these receive him there, he shall be said to be in an ill condition, and in straits and troubles; as a man on whom some have made an assault; who has many to combat with and none to assist and take his part; or like one that strives against the stream, or falls into a deep pool, and knows not how to swim; and yet by thrusting out his hands and feet, may obtain the bank and escape; though this seldom happens. Now a planet is said to be in the Angles of a Malevolent, when the Malevolent or Infortune, viz., Saturn or Mars, is in one sign, and the other Planet in the fourth, seventh or tenth from him: as if Mars be in Aries, and Mercury in Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn, he is said to be in his Angles: understand the like of their Corporal Conjunction. But if there be Reception, he does not afflict; for reception abates all malice, as we have said elsewhere.`},
    {id: 19, quote: `The Nineteenth Consideration is, To behold the Moon if she be ‘void of course,’ for then it signifies an impediment to the thing in question, it will not come to a good end, nor be accomplished; but the Querent shall be forced to desist with shame and loss.`},
    {id: 20, quote: `The Twentieth Consideration is, To observe whether the Moon or Significator be joined to any of the Planets, for thence you must derive your judgment of what is like to happen in business. Take notice therefore whether the planet to which the Moon or Significator joins, receives them; for then there will be good laudable end; and the matter will be accomplished with success, if the receiver be a Fortune. But if there be no reception, yet if the Moon or Significator shall give virtue to that planet, the thing will still come to pass. But if it be an Infortune, though they do not give him virtue, yet without a reception it will not do; but with a reception, if he be not afflicted, it signifies a good end of the matter, though not without much labour and tediousness.`},
    {id: 21, quote: `The Twenty-first Consideration is, To see from what planet the Moon separates: for that signifies what is past of the business: as from a Fortune the good, from an Infortune the ill that hath been.`},
    {id: 22, quote: `The Twenty-second Consideration is, To note which of the planets the Moon is now joined to, for that signifies what is now present; and from thence we must judge of the present state of the matter.`},
    {id: 23, quote: `The Twenty-third Consideration is, To behold to whom the Moon is now joining [or by applying Aspect], so as her Conjunction is not yet completed: for that signifies what is to come: wherefore if thou wouldst judge of a thing, which as yet is not, but ‘tis hoped will hereafter be brought to pass, ‘tis necessary then thou shouldst see to whom the Moon will next join; and according to her Significations judge whether good or evil.`},
    {id: 24, quote: `The Twenty-fourth Consideration is, To note whether the planet who is Significator be in his Declension, for then it causes a hindrance to everything thereby signified, and trouble and grief about it; and if the Question be about a prison wherein the Querent fears he shall be put, it signifies he shall be cast into the same together with disgrace and prejudice; and if the Question concerns one already in prison, it signifies a tedious confinement and more affliction than he believes.`},

And if it signified any good, it shall profit no more than he that hath spread a net for birds, and just touches the feathers of their tails, but never catches their bodies; and therefore ‘Zael’ says, “If a planet or the Moon be in the 29th degree of any Sign, its virtue is yet in that Sign wherein he is; because he has not yet wholly past the 29th degree.” etc.`},

On the other side Venus takes off the fury of Mars, by reason of that endearing intimacy which is between them, unless the thing be very difficult, as wars and bloodshed, etc. But she cannot so well divert the mischief of Saturn without the help of Jupiter (and then she can do it as well as at other times that of Mars).

And if it be Oriental, and one of the Superiors, or Occidental, and one of the Inferiors, and not Retrograde, he shall be strong and fit to perfect what he promises; as one that hath been ill, but is more perfectly recovered, or a building which fell and is repaired, and so of all other planets so disposed.`},

    {id: 58, quote: `The 58th is to consider, Whether the Significator be fixed in that Sign where he is found? Now “Zael” saith “That a Planet is not said to be fixed in a Sign till he hath passed 5 degrees thereof”. But I am of the opinion that when he hath passed one whole degree of a sign he is firmly therein, but he said it for more certainty. So likewise he says: “That a Planet is not said to be cadent from the Ascendant, unless he be removed from thence 5 degrees; as, for example, the Ascendant in 9 degrees of Aries, and a Planet was in the 5th degree thereof, ‘Ptolemy,’ and many other sages affirm, That Planet to be in an angle, with whom I agree; yet some would have it, that a Planet should be said to be in an angle, when he is in the very degree of the Ascendant, or one degree before it or two after it; but they meant in Revolutions, and that they might be so certain as not to be in the least deceived. But I have experienced that a Planet is in an Angle to the space of 5 degrees beyond the cusp; for as once I sought the Revolution of a year, I found Mars in the 5th degree beyond the cusp of the Angle of the earth in Capricorn, South Latitude, which signified the killing of the Roman Emperor; and acquainted him with it, for his court was at ‘Grossietti’ and I at ‘Forlirii’; and it was found that ‘Pandulfus de Farsenella’ and ‘Theobaldus Franciscus’, and divers others of the secretaries had conspired to slay him, and none of his own Astrologers observed it, because they did not believe that Mars was in an Angle, for he was 4 degrees beyond the cusp and 58 minutes in their opinion; however, after a Planet shall be removed from the cusp or line of any angle full 5 degrees or more, he is to be counted cadent from that angle”.`},

    {id: 60, quote: `The 60th is to consider, Whether the significator be in a Sign fixed, common, or moveable; because in a fixed Sign he signifies stability and countenance of the thing begun, or to be undertaken, or enquired of. In a common Sign, a change with a return or repeating of it, that the same will once be broken off, and afterwards begun again, or something added, or other alteration happen; for which reason in things that require alteration, as buying, selling, or the like, we should put the Significator and Moon, or one of them, into a common sign, but in a moveable Sign it signifies a sudden change, a quick dispatch or end whether good or evil. And therefore in matters where we desire a sudden conclusion, we ought to put the Significator in moveable Signs; but in things that we desire should be fixed and endure, we ought to place them in fixed Signs, where we would have a mean, let them be in common Signs, understand the same always of the nature of the Moon, if at any time thou canst observe it.`},

But no conjunction of the Dragon’s Head or Tail hurts, unless it be corporal for they have no Aspect or Opposition. And it is worse when the Significator or Moon goes towards them, than when they go from them; for in the first case is signified the mischief in its full height, like a man in a ship that is split in the sea, when there is no hope. But in the last, ‘tis like a ship that is only in danger, but has hopes and probabilities of escaping. And note that when the significator or Moon goes to the Dragon’s Head, its malice is augmented, for its nature is to increase, and when they go to the Tail, the mischief is not absolutely at the worst, as ‘tis when they go from it, that is, within one degree; for from one degree forwards ‘tis not so great as in that degree, although much; and from 1 degree to 3 degrees less, and from 3 degrees to 5 degrees yet less, and from 5 degrees to 7 degrees very small; from 7 degrees to 9 degrees smaller, and from thence to 12 degrees little or nothing at all.`},

And therefore, if she separates from an Infortune, and applies to a Fortune, the worst is past; and what hitherto has been had, will end happily to the Querent’s content. But if she separates from a Fortune, and goes to an Infortune, understand the contrary; the thing was good in the beginning, but proves naught in the end. If from a Fortune to a Fortune, is was and is good, and will have a laudable end. If from an Infortune to an Infortune, it will be an ugly conclusion. `},

And whether it be in reception of that Planet by whom it is aspected? For questions may sometimes seem good but the Part of Fortune happening in an untoward Place, weakens it much and renders it less profitable so as to deceive the Querent’s hopes. And on the contrary a question may seem ill, yet the Part of Fortune happening luckily, joined with a good Planet that receives it, etc., lessens the evil, and not so much happens to the Querent as the Figure otherwise seems to threaten.`},

But some jocund fools or monks, in their cups, may arise and say, If your judgments are changed according to the situation of Nations they are false. But there is no talking to such brutes, they neither understand nor believe, nor is anything probable to them: Yet there are some very learned men amongst them, such as ‘Conradus Brixiensis, ‘a preaching Friar, who excellently understands Art and practiseth it honestly. Want of heeding what I have said hath made Astrologers to err, and I doubt doth so still, for right judgments cannot be given but by the Ascendant and other Houses, and therefore, if these vary, those must do so too. Therefore you should have Tables of Elevation for every Climate and Region; yet ‘tis more difficult to find out the difference of one climate from another, than of one Region or country from another, according to the Longitude; for if thou hast tables of the elevation of the signs in any region from East to West, thou mayst by guess find the elevation in another, which way thou pleasest, either towards the East or West, according to the same climate, by taking the difference, but in divers climate thou canst not so easily conjecture.”`},

In Taurus three, one in the l°03', another in 8°07', and the last in 9°0l', all of the nature of Venus. In Gemini are two stars one in 19°02', the other in 21°08', both of the nature of Jupiter and of the second magnitude. In Cancer likewise two, one in 2°02', the other in 29°05', both of the nature of Jupiter. In Leo one in 9°04', of the nature of Jupiter and Venus.

Yet Messahala concealed this, and discovered the secret only to a certain scholar of his, who out of pride appropriated the same to himself. Now after thou hast found who is this destroyer, etc., then see to whom the Lord of the Ascendant or the Moon is joined (who participates in signification of everything, as we have said before), or the Lord of the thing enquired after, and Lord of the house of the Moon, or one or more of them; for if it be joined to a planet Retrograde or Combust, or cadent from the Ascendant, or any other Angle, or to any of the Infortunes who doth not receive him; or is afflicted by an Infortune, which cuts off the light of the significator: the thing is destroyed, and so the years of the Native are diminished and he lives not long. Further, If the Lord of the Ascendant, or the Moon, or the Lord of the thing enquired after, be joined to a Planet who is free from the conjunction of the Infortunes, and so is safe as to himself, but is joined to another Planet afflicted, some of the aforesaid ways, the matter shall be brought to nought, even after it seems accomplished, and the Native’s life shall be suddenly cut off, when there is all the probability that may be of the contrary: and this will also happen though there be no conjunction with the killing Planet, if only the significator or Moon be afflicted in manner aforesaid.`},

Which must be from the significators of the querent, and of the thing Questioned or enquired after: which two significators, if they shall be joined together with the Moon it signifies wholly and absolutely the effect of the thing; if not joined, then the contrary. And from the conjunction of the significators we ought to know why, or by what the question is made. And by the Lord of the House in which such conjunction happens, we know of what the question will be, or the end thereof; for if that be a Fortune it will be good, according to the condition and signification of such Fortune, and the House wherein he is, and signification of the Lord of that House and of the place in which the Lord is posited of that House wherein itself is. But if it be an Infortune, it will be bad, according to the signification of the Infortune, and such other positions as aforesaid. If the Lord of the House or Exaltation, or of any two smaller Dignities, casts an aspect, or there be a translation of Light, you may know by that the question shall be brought to pass: but if there be none of these it cannot be precisely known, but it will be by or from a cause not yet discovered: and by the aspects of the Fortunes or Infortunes may be known what will be the effects. `},

If it be in the 8th it denotes the decay and loss of their estate or substances, and increase of the Native’s. In the third, prejudice to the Native’s Brethren. In the fourth, to his Parents. In the fifth, to his children. In the sixth, to his servants. In the ninth, to his journeys. In the tenth, to his preferment. In the eleventh, to his Friends. In the twelfth, to his cattle of the greatest sort, etc. And so to all other things signified by each House respectively: so do Saturn and Mars also, but not so much.

But far otherwise will it be if Sagittarius, Taurus, or Pisces ascend and Jupiter, Venus and Mercury, shall be in the Ascendant, or if Jupiter and Venus shall happen to be in “Zaminium”, or the heart of the Sun, whatever the Ascendant be the native shall be admired as a Prophet, and all his words received as Oracles, or the dictates of destiny.`},

If it be in the second 10 degrees, or but with two of the said Planets, he shall find some, but not in so great quantity. In the last 10 degrees, and with but one less, and yet a considerable parcel; and if only the Part of Fortune be there not afflicted, then a small quantity. If the Sun behold it with a Trine or Sextile, it will be Gold uncoined; if the Moon, Silver; if Jupiter, a mixture of Gold and Silver, etc. If Venus, precious stones, Lockets, and for the most part Women’s Ornaments. But if they be Retrograde, he shall discover the treasure, but not for himself, another shall get the profit. If the Lord of the 8th behold the Lord of the Ascendant with a square or Opposition, the finder shall die by reason of it; but if it be with a Trine or Sextile, he shall only catch some small disease or sickness. If the Dragon’s Tail be there instead of the Head, he shall find it, but it shall be taken from him; he shall find it, but it shall be taken from him; or being ignorant what it is, he shall give it away almost for nothing; and if the Moon be then separated from the Lord of the Ascendant and joined to an Infortune that afflicts her, he to whom ‘tis so given shall have little profit by it. If Mars or the Lord of the Eighth behold the Lord of the Ascendant, they that take it from him shall kill him.

If they happen to be above 15’ distance, the same thou mayst conclude if the Moon shall be ill the very minute of Opposition to the Sun, and a Fortune be in the seventh, which signifies the estate of the Querent or Native in respect of his wives, companions, or enemies.

And if such Fixed Stars shall be of the first Magnitude and sole Significators, the Native or Querent shall be raised to vast honours and riches, almost inestimable: which if beheld by the Lord of the Ascendant, then his fame and honour lies in his own person; if by the Lord of the 2nd, in his riches; if by the Lord of the 10th in his offices, command, or empire; and this though in never so poor and vile people; the meaner their condition was, to so much the greater height shall they arrive.

And look, how much the more sublime was their fortune, by so much the more grievous, miserable, and calamitous shall be their fall: for they shall die an ignoble filthy death, or if they escape it, the same shall happen to their next successor.`},
    {id: 125, quote: `The l25th Consideration, is to observe in Nativities or Questions what sign ascends: if it be the sign of a Planet that hath two Houses, the exercise or troubles of the Native or Querent shall be chiefly in those things signified by the other House of the said Planet, which shall lightly happen to him and for the most part through his own means. As if the Ascendant be in Aries, he shall be excused in those things as shall be in the cause of his own death or fall because Scorpio the other House of Mars will be then in the Eighth House: but if Mars be well disposed and the Part of Fortune happen in the Eighth he shall be very fortunate in all things signified by that House. If Taurus ascend he shall be exercised in those things as shall cause his own weakness, because Libra which is the other House of Venus will be then the Sixth House. But if Venus be well disposed, and Part of Fortune in the Sixth, he shall be most lucky in things appertaining to the Sixth House. If the Ascendant be in Gemini he shall be exercised in such things as shall occasion his being taken; because Virgo, Mercury’s other House, will be on the fourth; but if Mercury be well disposed and Part of Fortune in the fourth, he will be prosperous in things belonging to the Fourth House. If Virgo ascend, he will be exercised in things that will gain him honour and power, because Gemini, Mercury’s other House, is in the tenth. If Mercury be then in Conjunction with the Part of Fortune and in the Ascendant, he shall acquire as it were a king’s revenue. But if Mercury be in the tenth with the Part of Empire, fortunate and strong, he shall undoubtedly obtain a Kingdom or supreme command; and if this Part of Fortune and the Moon be also in the Tenth, he will be a mighty Prince infallibly. If Libra ascend, he shall be exercised in things that shall hasten his own death, because Taurus the other House of Venus will be then in the Eighth. But if Venus be well disposed and the Part of Fortune in the Eighth he will be lucky in things represented by the Eighth House: and so of any other sign. Scorpio ascending the Native or Querent shall bring diseases on himself because Aries is the sixth. Sagittarius ascending, he shall fool himself into captivity because Pisces is on the Fourth. Capricorn ascending, he shall gain much by his industry, for Aquarius is then on the Second House. But if Saturn be ill disposed he shall squander away and waste his own substance idly. If Aquarius ascend he shall procure himself many secret enemies. Because Capricorn will be then in the Twelfth House. If Pisces ascend, he shall raise himself to honour, etc.`},
    {id: 126, quote: `The 126th consideration is, to take notice in Nativities and Questions, whether Mercury be significator wholly or in part, fortunate and strong and in Capricorn or Aquarius? For then the Native shall be of profound and piercing wit, and great understanding; one that shall dive into the bottom of things, and see from the beginning what the issue will be; and so much the more if Saturn fortunate shall behold Mercury with a good aspect, especially if Mercury be in Aquarius, which is the delight of Saturn; and still more if a Fortune shall be with Mercury, and he with one of the propitious Fixed Stars. But if Mercury be in Aries or Scorpio, the Native will be bold, Perfidious, inconstant, arrogant, and yet quick of apprehension; rather nimble to repeat or find out things said by others than invent them himself.`},
    {id: 127, quote: `The 127th Consideration is, to observe in Nativities, if the Lord of the Ascendant be Saturn or Mars, and sole Lord of the Nativity, without any Fortune partaking in the dominion, the taste or smelling of the native or his complexion shall not be like those of other men, for if it be Saturn he shall delight in sour or insipid things, as ‘Halion Ptolemy’ avers; if it be Mars, in sharp and bitter, flesh half stinking, wine dead, and pallid aloes, snuffs of candles, dung, etc., as also with filthy, dirty, unhandsome women; more than in others; or if it be a woman, in the homeliest men, etc.`},
    {id: 128, quote: `The l28th Consideration is, in Nativities, whether the Ascendant be a human sign or the Lord of it in a human sign? For that signifies the native an honest, sociable, and neighbourly man, more especially if both happen together. But if the Ascendant carry the similitude of some creatures which men use to labour with, as Aries, Taurus, the last part of Sagittarius and Capricorn, the Native is very submissive and humble to men, yet very sociable. But if it be a sign halfferal, as Cancer and Pisces, he will be yet less sociable; but if it be a feral, furious or savage sign, as Leo and Scorpio, he will be of a brutish temper, delighting in the woods, hunting and living upon spoils and rapine; caring not to associate himself with men, so that he seldom remains long with his own Parents or nearest Relations.`},
    {id: 129, quote: `The 129th Consideration is, to observe in Nativities, whether the Moon be in Opposition to the Sun, with any of the stars called “cloudy” which are ‘Althazaic’, and the “Head of Gemini,’ or in a place called ‘The Place of Falling into the Water,’ which Aquarius spouts forth, or the drops of the Lion, said to be near his heart, and others which by reason of their mixture with each other do not shine distinctly (nebulous stars). For when the Moon shall not be above 10 minutes’ distance from them, according to Longitude and Latitude, it seems unavoidable that the native shall have diseases in his eyes; not to be remedied by any human help or medicine. If the Moon be then Occidental in an Angle and Mars and Saturn likewise Occidental, not far distant from her, or opposing the Sun in any of the Angles: it signifies that the native shall be blind of both eyes at his death; nor does there appear any way whereby it may be prevented; but if it be not of luminaries, but only one, he shall lose but one eye, and if it be Sol and a man the right eye, if a woman the left eye: but if it be the Moon and a man, the left eye; but if a woman, the right eye `},
    {id: 130, quote: `The 130th Consideration is, to regard in Nativities whether the Moon be joined with Mercury by Body or Aspect, or there be a translation of light by any planet between them? If there be nothing of this and the sign ascending be neither of the nature of Mercury or the Moon; and Saturn in a diurnal nativity and Mars in a nocturnal, and one be in an Angle, the native will be mad, distracted, troubled with fits, a fool or at least exceedingly forgetful, unless a Fortune very strong shall at the same time behold the Ascendant, Mercury, or the Moon: and so much the worse if the Angle wherein such Infortune is, happen to be Cancer, which is the exaltation of Jupiter, or Virgo the exaltation of Mercury, or Pisces the exaltation of Venus. The reason is because the Moon in Nativities is the general Significatrix of the native’s Person; and the Planet with whom she is joined of his faculties and powers; and therefore if she be corporally joined or applying to such Planet, the native will prove of good understanding, and very well retain his senses and intellectuals. And if Mercury be in Capricorn or Aquarius, not afflicted, but in good condition, the native will be of an exceeding wit, and a great Philosopher, and if Jupiter and Venus be in (Zamini Solis) he will prove a Hermit or kind of Prophet, whose words shall be received as Oracles beyond those of other men.`},
    {id: 131, quote: `The 131st Consideration is, To take notice of the Nativity of a man, whether the Sun and Moon be both in Masculine Signs, or both in one Masculine Quarter or one Masculine Sign; for if so, it signifies that the native’s acts and temper shall be naturally such as belong to men. But in a woman’s Nativity, the Luminaries so disposed, make a kind of Virago, one that shall despise men, and obtrude herself into their affairs; and such a one, if she marry, will be sure to wear the breeches. If Venus and Mars shall be both in Masculine signs, the native will be moderately affected towards the delights of Venus, and use them according to nature and law; but if they happen to be Oriental, he will be more fallacious and immoderate, inclinable to incest, sodomy, etc. But if they be Occidental and in Feminine Signs, his spirits will be nasty and brutish; and so much the more, if Saturn cast any Aspect to them. But if it be a Woman, and Mars and Venus Oriental and in Masculine Signs, she will abhor men’s embraces, and take no delight therein, but rather please herself with some little wantonness with persons of her own sex. But if Mars and Venus be in Feminine Signs and Occidental, she will love and take delight in men’s kindness. And Ptolemy in his Centiloquium affirms, That if Venus be joined with Saturn in a Nativity, and have Dignities in the Seventh, the Native shall be somewhat faulty and untoward in his venereal caresses.`},
    {id: 132, quote: `The 132nd is to mark in Nativities, Whether Mars be corporally joined with a certain Fiery star of his own nature in Taurus, called ‘Algol’, so that they are not above 16 minutes asunder, Mars applying thereunto and the Lord of the House wherein the Luminary, for the time ruling is pointed, which is called the Lord ‘Anaubae’; or of its Exaltation, and two others of its Dignities, and shall be in Opposition or Square of Mars, and neither of the Fortunes shall behold the Ascendant, nor be pointed in the 8th House; it undoubtedly signifies the native shall be beheaded. And if Mars shall not be distant from it in Latitude above 6 minutes, it will infallibly happen so; not to be avoided but by God alone. And though a Fortune, Retrograde, or Combust should behold the Ascendant, yet it will scare preserve him from beheading: only in such cases it may happen not to be occasioned by his own fault: for a Fortune in such a case not impedited, may save him from such an ill death, and permit him to die in his bed, but then it will be of some capital disease, proceeding from a hot house, and this before he comes to be fifty years of age. But if Mars shall not be thus affected, yet if an Infortune be in the 8th, the Native shall come to an untimely or ignominious end; but if a Fortune be there in good state, he shall expire naturally; but if such Fortune be afflicted, he shall die of some mischance coming upon him.`},
    {id: 133, quote: `The 133rd consideration is, To mark in Nativities, whether Gemini or Sagittarius ascend, and whether its Lord be well disposed, that is, fortunate and strong, and likewise the Moon; for that signifies that if the native live, he will get great riches. If Virgo or Pisces ascend and its Lord or the Moon be well affected, he shall get money and lay the same out well, and live splendidly, being beloved for his generosity and bounty. But in the other case where the Ascendant is Gemini or Sagittarius, he will not be so liberal, but very frugal and sparing; besides, he who hath Gemini or Virgo for his Ascendant may lose his estate and come to want; but he that hath Sagittarius or Pisces shall never lose his means, nor fall into poverty. If Aries, Scorpio, Capricorn, or Aquarius ascend, the native will be miserably covetous. If Jupiter behold the Ascendant, he may somewhat mitigate the sordid humour, but will not wholly prevent or take it away.`},
    {id: 134, quote: `The 134th is, to mind in Nativities, whether Mars or Venus be in the Sixth, and likewise well disposed? for that signifies that the native shall be not really fit for Physic, and grow a perfect doctor in every part of the Art. If Mercury be in conjunction with Venus and she Retrograde, he will make naturally a good singer; but if Mercury be in the Twelfth not afflicted, he will be studious and famous in most sciences, especially Philosophy.`},
    {id: 135, quote: `The 135th consideration is, To consider in Nativities, whether the Lord of the Ascendant and the Moon, and Jupiter, and Venus, are either all in the Ascendant, or whether Jupiter and Venus behold the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon in the Ascendant by a trine or Sextile, and free from affliction? for then the native will prove very strong and courageous; and none will dare to disobey his commands. `},
    {id: 136, quote: `The 136th consideration is, To note in the Nativities of Kings and rich men, and such grandees as are fit to bear rule, whether both Luminaries are in the Degrees of their Exaltations, or in their own Houses, in the dame degree one with the other, and free from affliction? for this signifies that the native shall obtain great honours; for he shall be made Emperor, or something like it; so that he shall be as it were monarch of the world, which shall continue to the fourth generation of his posterity. But if all the Planets below Jupiter shall be disposed of by him and he shall receive virtue from every one of them, notwithstanding the condition aforesaid, and afterwards commit both them, and himself to Saturn, and both be Oriental from the Sun and in Angles, the native will be a person of great renown and power, although perhaps not with the title of king; but his fame shall endure for a long time, that is to say, all his lifetime; and after his death for three revolutions of Saturn, or longer.`},
    {id: 137, quote: `The 137th is, To see whether Mercury be in conjunction with Saturn in the Ascendant? For that signifies that the native is a foolish talkative fellow, that would be counted wise; he shall speak ill of both men and women; the greatest wit he hath is to invent many lies; nor doth he ever open his mouth, but something of untruth appears intermixed with his discourse: so natural it will be for him to tell lies, Saturn give him a foul tongue, and Mercury a sharpness of malice to employ it.`},
    {id: 138, quote: `The 138th is to see in Nativities, Whether the two Infortunes are in the Fourth House, or whether the Angles are possessed with moveable signs, and Mars and Saturn in them? For then the native will be poor, wretched, and unfortunate, above all others, all his lifetime, unless Jupiter, of the Lord of the Triplicity ascending prevent.`},
    {id: 139, quote: `The 139th is, To be careful, both in Nativities and Questions, where the Dragon’s Tail is? For that signifies the wasting and destruction of the thing signified by that House, especially if it relates to gain, for in the first it signifies expenses, and loss of gain to the Querent, from or by reason of his person: in the 2nd, destruction and loss by means of money and substance; in the 3rd, loss by means of Brethren, Sisters, Neighbours, etc.: in the fourth, damage that one shall sustain by one’s Grandfather, Father-in-law, and such things relating to Inheritances; and that the Native shall change Houses often, and get little by it; in the 5th, damage from or by reason of children, in the 6th, losses by servants or small cattle; in the 7th, loss by Women, Companions, or open Enemies: in the 9th, loss by Religious Men, and on the account of religion; in the 10th, by or in his preferments, honours, etc.: in the 11th, loss by his friends, or for their sakes: and in the 12th, damage sustained by great Cattle, or by means of hidden enemies.`},
    {id: 140, quote: `The 140th consideration is, to see whether the Significator of the thing in question, or the Moon be so weak that it cannot bring the matter to perfection? And if they be, take the Significator of the Querent and thing inquired after, and subtract the lesser from the greater, and add to the remainder the degrees of the sign Ascending, and project what they amount unto from the Ascendant, and observe where it happens; for the Lord of that sign signifies what was enquired of and according to his conditions shalt thou give judgment, as thou findest him fortunate and strong, or unfortunate and weak. For if the business concern a man’s estate, and he be placed in the Second, as he is; so shall the Querent’s estate prove; if in the Third, the Brethren, Neighbours, etc., etc., will be disposed accordingly; in the fourth, those of greatest Relations; in the Fifth the Children; in the Sixth, Servants; in the Seventh, Wives; in the 8th Wives’ portions; in the 9th, Long journeys; in the 10th his preferments; in the 11th his Friends; in the 12th, his secret Enemies.`},
    {id: 141, quote: `The 141st Is to consider in Nativities the gifts and properties bestowed on men by the fixed Stars, and how long they continue, together with the reason why they prove, not lasting as those which proceed from the Planets, since it seems a little probable that they should continue longer than those; of which I do not remember to have met with anything in the Ancients, save only that “Ptolomy” in his Centiloquium says, The fixed Stars sometimes confer exceeding great benefits; but oftentimes they end ill. And ‘Almansa’ in his Treatise to the Great King of the Saracens, says that the Fixed Stars bestow notable gifts, and raise from poverty to happiness and high degree more than any of the seven planets: Now the reason that the gifts of the Fixed Stars to men, abide less with them than those given by the Planets is, because the fixed stars being the Agents, and the men the Patients; the subject on which they are to operate are not agreeable to them, nor are born to be able to receive their impression; for it is requisite that there should be some conformity and likeness, or agreeableness between the Agent and the Patient; but the fixed stars are most slow in motion; and consequently in mutation, whence it comes to pass that their impressions require subjects and patients of the same nature; that is to say, such as are the most lasting, and carry a conformity with them to prefect or accomplish their effects: For the Revolution of the Fixed Stars is finished, but in six and thirty thousand years, but the “Viventhipolis” or life of man, generally exceeds not three revolutions of Saturn: that is to say, the space of ninety years; very few exceed that age, thought possibly some may by the addition of the years of some Planets to the years of the “Alcocoden” in their Nativities, which bears no conformity or proportion with 36,000 years to complete the effects of their influences. And therefore as an Eagle cannot exercise the complement of her flight or power on a Fly, nor a Stone coming forth (a Sundra trabathi) do any great execution (in Musciovem) no more can the Fixed Stars complete the effects of their impressions; and therefore their gifts or the good promised by them continue no longer with men, because men are of so small a duration, and subject to a swift mutability in respect of their Motion. And upon this is that Aphorism grounded, that Advises to make use of Fixed Stars in the foundation of Cities, but of Planets in the erection of Houses; because Cities are generally of the longest continuance amongst corruptible things, and far more durable than particular Houses: for these in respect of their individuals do not endure always, whereas Cities remain by a successive building and rebuilding of Houses; and therefore though Castles are very lasting, yet are they not equal in this respect to Cities; so that although we may use the superior planets in elections for building Castles, it is better to take Fixed Stars; yet still because Cities are of longer continuance than Castles, they are more appropriated to the fixed Stars, whose Subjects they are. For the impression which a solid thing makes in a more solid thing, continues much longer than that which it makes on a less solid thing; and far less in a thing not solid, than a thing somewhat solid; and yet less in a very slippery transient thing, than in a thing less lubricous or changeable. Hence the impressions which the Fixed Stars make on Cities are more correlative to them in length of time, and accordingly those of Castles more durable than those of Houses, for the same reason proportionally. But bodies of men are more remote from those fixed stars than Houses themselves, and so more corruptible; and for that cause their Significations apply less to them, or if they happen, abide but little; the Significations of the fixed Stars being so great and noble, so high and free from corruption and mutability, that they cannot easily take upon them a variable commixture with things quickly corruptible and suddenly changeable, unless it be as oil on water; for though it may enter into it, yet such impression will not long continue; for the fixed Lights operate with so much nobleness, that by reason of their long distance from those vile corruptible changeable bodies, and neighbourhood to the Supreme Light, their effects cannot remain in or with them, when they are lightly or suddenly changed and corrupted; especially in base people and mean spirits; for they seldom transcend his person to whom they happen, and oftentimes leave him whilst he lives, and that to his damage, so great that God alone can prevent; as I affirm for the most part; though ‘tis possible they may sometimes terminate in good and continue long: As it hath sometimes happened that some have lived to the greatest years of the Alcocoden, of whom I never say but one in my time, who was named Richard, who affirmed himself to have been a Courtier under Charles the Great, King of France, and that he had lived 500 years. At what time there was a report of one that had continued alive ever since our Saviour’s days called ‘Johan Buttadeus’ because he had impulissed the Lord as he was led to be crucified, Who said to him, “Thou shalt expect, or wait for me, till I come.” The aforesaid Richard I saw at Ravenna in the year 1223, and the said John is said to have passed through Florilivium, in his journey to St. James’s at Compostella, in the year 1267. Nor could the Significations of the Fixed Stars be applied; or adhere to men nor sensibly remain in them, unless there were some Medium by which they might Act upon them which are the Planets, which are secondary Agents, as the first are principal; for whenever there are divers actions in order, attributed to several Agents, the principal act ought to be referred to the principal Agent, which in respect of the effects on corruptible things, was the Primary Cause. And the Planets as Secondary: for that corruption which those inferiors suffer, happens by reason of their too great distance from the incorruptible superiors; yet their effects sometime continue long in Grandees, and persons very rich, who are apt for Empire, magnanimous, and of brave and excellent spirits; such as in my time was the Emperor Frederick the Second, who when he was indigent and in great necessity, was arrived to the Imperial Dignity, and brought under his obedience all Apulia, the Kingdom of Sicily, Jerusalem, Crocovia, Italy and the whole Roman Empire (except Lombardy) subduing all Enemies, Traitors and Rebels, and remained in that illustrious flourishing condition; yet at last died miserably, being poisoned by his domestics, and all his family extirpated so that scarce any of them remained. Such an other was Ecilinus de Romano, who when he was but mean, was far exalted above all other Italians, for he ruled and, as it were, tyrannized over the Marquisate of Treves even to Almaine and Trent, and within four or five miles of Venice, and his Tyranny continued twenty-six years; but at last all these glories were overcast with calamity, for when it seemed impossible to suppress him, he fell into the hands of his enemies at a battle in the Country of Mediolanensi apud Cassianum, and died wretched, and all his posterity was destroyed, not one of them remaining. In the same manner there was one in the Kingdom of Apulias of base descent, called Peter de Vinea: who when he was a scholar at Bononia was forced to beg for his living, and had not bread to eat, yet was made a notary, and after that Protonotary of the Court of the Emperor Frederick the Second; he became a Judge and climbed to such grandeur, that he was happy that could obtain the least of his favour, for whatever he did the Emperor would confirm; but himself would often set aside what had been established by the Emperor, who made him Lord of Apulin; whereby he grew so rich, that he had 10,000 pounds of Gold besides other Treasures almost inestimable; yet in the end he fell, and was reduced to such misery, that the Emperor ordered his eyes to be put out; enraged at which out of mere indignation he struck out his own against a wall, as it was then commonly reported. Another was at Pysa called Smerolus one of the dregs of the vulgar, who came to be, as it is said, Lord of that Province: nor durst any of the nobility for a while contend with him; yet at last he came to nothing. After whom one Oddo Gualduzius, a mean fellow, tapered up so high that he did as it were, sway the whole city and none would contradict him, till Galyver, a Judge, caused him to be chopped all to pieces. The same happened at Florylycium. One called Simon Mustaguere the son of obscure Parents, who mounted so high that all the people adored him: nor durst any oppose him, save only myself, who knew him thoroughly; and what mischief he could, he did at his pleasure for three years’ space: but at last down he came being banished from the City which happened for the odiousness of his person and cowardice. Another being a Friar of the Preaching Order, by name John by Nation Vicentinus, was admired as a Saint by all the Italians that acknowledged the Roman Church; but I ever thought him an Hypocrite; he grew so high that he was reported to have raised 18 from the Dead (though never one of them could be seen), and to cure all diseases, fright Devils, etc., yet could I not perceive anybody freed by him, though I made much enquiry into his Miracles; however the whole world seemed to run after him, and he thought himself happy that could get a thread of his Cap, which they esteemed equal with the relics of the Saints; and in his preaching he would publicly boast, that he had Converse with Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and Angels when he list. By which tricks, the Friars of his order at Bononia got more than 20,000 marks. And his power was so great that by his own will he released a Soldier as he was going to Execution for murder, Nor durst the Magistrates deny him, nor speak ill of him but myself, who knew all his wheadles and cozenages: for which the rabble, merely out of fear of him, reported me an Heretic. In which esteem and pomp he continued above a year, but at last went out like the snuff of a candle, with a stink, his devices and hypocrisies being discovered, so that he became as generally: and everybody was ashamed to be seen in his company.`},
    {id: 142, quote: `The 142nd Consideration is, To observe in Nativities and general questions, the gifts and good advantages bestowed on men by the Planets: because those are applied more easily to them, and continue longer extended to their successors, according as they are well disposed in the Radices of their Nativities; but they are seldom exceeding great, unless when applied by fortunate Fixed Stars; because being of a more swift mutability they have a closer affinity with them, especially if proceeding from the inferior Planets; for their conformity with men, their correlative subjects. Those of the Superiors last not so long with men but in building of houses they are much better than the other. `},

For if the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the hour be the same or the Signs wherein those Significators are placed be of the same Triplicity or complexion the Question is serious; but otherwise, if the Ascendant shall be the end of any Sign, the Question is not Radical.<br>2.Behold the Ascendant and his Lord, the Moon and the Planet from which she separates and assign them for Significators of the Querent; the Seventh and the Planet with which the Moon is joined, shall represent the person enquired after; but if it be necessary, descend to the persons, as the things are signified by the Houses, from the first to the twelfth.<br>3.Consider the nature of the thing enquired about, the House and Sign whereby it is signified.<br>4.The Aspects of the Planets both good and malevolent to the Significators of the things sought after.<br>5.In what place from its own House each of the Significators are: viz., Whether in his own or the second, third, or fourth, etc., or in the Combust way or the like places.<br>6.Whether they are found in Angles Cadent or Succedent Houses.<br>7.Diligently see where the Querent’s Assistants must come, viz., whether from a Father, a Son, a King, a Kinsman, or a Friend, etc.<br>8.By the mirth of the Querent, as if the Lord of the Ascendant shall be in the fifth, or elsewhere joined with its Lord; free from being afflicted by the Infortunes. Or by his sadness; as if his Significator happen in the 6th, 7th 8th, or 12th; unless the question be of things signified by those Houses; and as thou findest so judge.<br>9.By the Fortunes and Infortunes, according as thou findest them in places signified, the things about which the Querent is moved; and if the benevolents are more, ‘tis good, if otherwise the contrary; if the testimonies are equal, then indifferent.<br>10.Whether the Lord of the Ascendant be in the House of the thing enquired after, or with its Lord.<br>11.In what House the Lord of the first is joined with the Significator of the things looked after; for by the Significator of that House, or his occasion, thou mayst judge the matter will be brought about.<br>12. If the Significators are not joined there, whether there be any Translation of Light between them by any Planet, or receives their description, thou shalt judge the same thing.<br>13. By the natures of the Significators themselves, agreeing in their natures and significations with each other.<br>14. According as the receiver of the Significators’ virtue or disposition shall be a Fortune or Infortune strong or weak, and does behold the Significator, or the Moon, or any with Aspect of love or enmity, so shalt thou pronounce judgment.`},
    {id: 144, quote: `The 144th Consideration is, To observe in Questions, Nativities, or Elections, when the Significators shall not clearly show thee what thou wouldst know but the signification remains dubious, so that the mind is in suspense, take the place of the Lord of the Ascendant, and the place of the Lord of the House of the Moon, and see the distance of degrees between them, beginning from Aries, of which make signs, and add the degree of the sign ascending: and project from the Ascendant as well by day as night, and where the number falls, the Lord of that House shall be Significator and from him take the Signification of the business enquired, for according to his disposition thou mayest judge `},
    {id: 145, quote: `The 145th Consideration is, That thou see in Diurnal Nativities, whether Cor Leonis* be in the Ascendant, that is to say in the Oriental Line or above it one degree or below it three degrees; or whether it be in the tenth in like degrees, without the Conjunction or Aspect of any of the Fortunes; for this alone signifies that the Native shall be a person of great note and power, too much exalted, and attain too high preferment and honours, although descended from the meanest parents. And if any of the Fortunes behold that place also, his glory shall be the more increased: but if the Nativity be nocturnal, his fortune will be somewhat meaner, but not much; but if the Infortunes cast their aspects there it will still be more mean; but if the Fortunes behold it also they will augment the good promised a fourth part, and mitigate the evil as much; yet still whatever of all this happens, it signifies that the Native shall die an unhappy death; or at least that all his honours, greatness, and power, shalt at last suffer an eclipse, and set in a cloud.`},
    {id: 146, quote: `The l46th consideration is, That thou take the place of the Lord of the Ascendant, and the place of the Lord of the 12th, and subtracting the lesser from the greater add to the remainder the degrees of the sign ascending and project from the Ascendant; and where the number falls the Lord of the sign shall be partner with the Lord of the Question, and shall be called the Principal Partner. Again, take the place of the Lord of the said sign, and the place of the Lord of the Part of Fortune, and subtracting the lesser from the greater add the degrees of that sign ascending ; and where the number falls, the Lord of the Sign shall be another Partner, and be called the Secondary Partner; which if it happen to be the same Planet, regard only that; but if different, then take both and subtract the lesser from the greater and add the degrees of the sign ascending, and the planet on whose House the number falls shall be the third Partner; and which of those three is the strongest shall be the chiefest sharer in the significations of the thing enquired after. If all the remainders, or two of them, shall happen on the House of one Planet; that shall be preferred. If the Question seem good, and those Partners are ill disposed, they will diminish of the good signified by the Question, and so on the contrary; but if the Question seem evil, and they are well disposed, they will allay and mitigate the evil signified by the Question, and so likewise on the contrary.`}
