    {id: 1, quote: `The First, is to observe what it is that moves a person to propose or ask a question of an Astrologer; where we must take notice of three motions: the First, of the mind, when a man is stirred up in his thoughts and hath an intent to enquire; a Second, of the superior and celestial bodies; so that they at that time imprint on the thing enquired after, what shall become of it; the Third, of the free will which disposes him to the very act of enquiring; for although the mind be moved to enquire, 'tis not enough, unless the superior bodies sympathize therewith; nor is such motion of the stars enough, unless by the election of his will the person does actually enquire.`},
    {id: 2, quote: `The Second consideration is (what we hinted at before) the method or manner everyone ought to observe that enquires of an Astrologer; which is, that when he intends to take an artist’s judgment of things past, present, or to come, he should, first, with a devout spirit, pray unto the Lord, from whom proceeds the success of every lawful enterprise, that he would grant him the knowledge of those things of the truth of which he would be resolved; and then let him apply himself to the astrologer with a serious intent of being satisfied in some certain and particular doubt, and this not on trifling occasions, or light sudden emotions, much less in matters base or unlawful, as many ignorant people used to do; but in matters of honest importance, and such as have possessed and disturbed his mind for the space of a day and night or longer; unless in sudden accidents which admit not of delay.`},
    {id: 3, quote: `The Third, is to consider how many ways Planets operate upon Inferior Bodies according to the divers Qualities of their motions: there being Sixteen different ways of such their operations and effects in all things that are either wholly or in part perfected or destroyed.`},
    {id: 4, quote: `The Fourth, is to consider particularly these several Sixteen ways, and what are the assisting causes that help forward things to perfection, and what there are that destroy things after they are perfected. <Br>Now of these the first is Profection, or an advance of or in, things, which the philosophers call ‘Alchecohol.’<br>2. Detriment, which they call ‘Aliber.’ <br>3. Conjunction or Reversion, which they call ‘Alitifall.’ <br>4. Separation, which they call ‘Alnichirat.’<br>5. Translation of light, which they call ‘Annecad.’ <br>6. Collection, which they call ‘Algemei.’ <br>7. Prohibition, which they call ‘Almana.’ <br>8. Reception, called ‘Alcobol.’ <br>9. Being void of course, called ‘Gastalcobal.’ <br>10. Permission, called   ‘Galaalocir.’ <br>11. The restoring or giving of virtue or disposition, called ‘Alteat.’ <br>12. The withdrawing of virtue, called ‘Dalpha Alchoa.’ <br>13. The withdrawer or driver away of disposition, called ‘Daffaredbit.’ <br>14. Fortitude, ‘Alcoevah.’ <br>15. Debility, ‘Adirof.’ <br>The 16th is the state of the Moon called ‘Gnaymel,’ or the Moon ill-affected; which the ancients generally hold to be of ill signification.`},
    {id: 5, quote: `The Fifth, is to consider, how many ways the Moon comes to be so ill-affected, which are generally reckoned to be Ten, but in my opinion Seven more may be added, whereby hindrances and damage happen in all Questions, Nativities, Elections, and actions whatsoever; the First is, where the Moon is combust, that is to say under the Sun’s Beams, which is counted from 15 degrees of the body of the Sun as she applies to him to 12 degrees distance from him as she is separating from him; and the impediment is greater when she is going to the Sun than when she is going from him; because as she goes off, when she is got five degrees distant, she is said to be escaped, though not wholly freed. As when a fever hath left a man, he is said to be recovered, although he be weak and faint, because he is secure now that he shall obtain his health again. The 2nd is when she is in the degrees of her descensions, that is in the 3rd degree of Scorpio, or in any part of Scorpio or Capricorn or injoined with any planet that is in her or its own descensions, as if she be joined with the Sun, who is in Scorpio or Capricorn or in in his proper descension, viz., in Aquary or Libra, viz., in its 19th degree or in any part of Libra; or should be joined with Mars, and he be in Libra or Taurus, or in the 28th degree, or in any part of Cancer; and so with any other Planet or Planets respectively. The 3rd is when she is posited in any of the combust degrees, of which the worst are: those 12 degrees which are before the degree which is directly opposite to the degree in which the Sun is, wherever she shall happen to be, The 4th is when she is in conjunction, opposition, or square to either of the Infortunes, Saturn or Mars, without a perfect reception; for with one it hinders but little, but in all other places ‘tis a grand impediment, both in the said aspect and also in corporal conjunction save only where the Infortune shall have two of his smaller dignities, as with Saturn in the 4 last degrees of Aries or Gemini, in each of which he has a Term and a Triplicity; or with Mars in the last 10 degrees of Pisces, where he has a Face and a Triplicity; and so in any other sign or place. The 5th is when she is with the Dragon’s Head or with the Dragon's Tail, that is, within twelve degrees of either of them, because that is the place where she is eclipsed. The 6th is when she is in Gemini, which is the twelfth from her own House. The 7th is when she is in the end of Signs, which are all Terms of the Infortunes, except the last 6 degrees of Leo, which belong to Jupiter; but in the first eight she is weakened because they are the Terms of Saturn. If it be objected by the same reason she must be impedited likewise in the first 6 degrees of Cancer, since they are terms of Mars, I answer no, because Cancer is her own House and greatest Fortitude. The 8th is when she is in the 6th, 8th, 9th or 12th Houses (not in reception with the Ascendant), or joined to any Planet that is in any of them or posited in the Third House, because it is cadent from angles; yet because the same is said to be her joy (or that she delights therein), she is not afflicted there so much as in other Cadent Houses. The 9th is when she is between the 15th degree of Libra and the 15th degree of Scorpio, which 30 degrees are called Combust Way. The 10th when she is void of course, that is, not joined to any planet by body or aspect, or in that condition when they call her Feral or Desart, that is, in a place where she has not any dignity. The 11th when she is slow of course, because then she may be compared to a Planet Retrograde. The 12th when she is in want of light, so that no part or very little of her is seen, which happens about the end of the lunar month. The 13th when she is besieged by the two Infortunes impediting her. The 14th if she be in Azimene degrees. The 15th if in Pitted degrees. The 16th if in Smoky Degrees. The 17th and last is when she is posited in those degrees which are called Dark. To know and distinguish all which you have Tables commonly in most Books of Astrology`},
    {id: 6, quote: `The Sixth Consideration, is to regard another manner whereby planets are debilitated or weakened and afflicted, not much different from the former, which comes to pass Ten ways. <br>The 1st, when a planet is Cadent from Angles or from the Ascendant, so that he does not behold the same. <br>The 2nd, when the Planet is Retrograde. <br>The 3rd, if they be combust, that is, within 15 degrees before or after the Sun; the lower Planets are more debilitated, being behind the Sun, and the less before him, when they are direct; but when retrograde the contrary. <br>4. When any of them is in Opposition, Corporal Conjunction, or Square of either or both the Infortunes without Reception. <br>5. When they are besieged by the Infortunes, so as to separate from one and be joined to another, without perfect reception of House, Exaltation, or two of the smaller Dignities, which are Term, Triplicity and Face. <br>When a Planet is joined to another in his Declension or Fall, that is, in Opposition to its own House or Exaltation. <br>7. When it is joined to a Planet Cadent from the Ascendant, or separates from a Planet that did receive him, and is joined to another that doth not. <br>8. When a Planet is Peregrine, that is, in a place where he hath not any Dignity; or being one of the Superiors is followed by the Sun, or being of the Inferiors when it follows the Sun. <br>9. When a Planet is with the Head or Tail of the Dragon, without Latitude. <br>10. When a planet weakens itself, that it, when it is in the seventh house from its own, Feral, or not in Reception. <br>These are the Impediments of the Planets, that cause Hindrances, delays, and mischiefs in Nativities, Questions, Elections, etc.; all which thou oughtest to be well acquainted with. There are some more that seem necessary to be known, but to avoid tediousness and confusion I shall at present omit them.`},
    {id: 7, quote: `The Seventh Consideration, is to beware of those cases wherein the Astrologer is subject to err and mistake; of which the learned have named four: 1. When the Querent is so silly that he knows not how to ask, nor what he would have. 2. When the time for which the figure is erected is mistaken. 3. When the Artist knows not whether the Sun be gone off the line of the Mid-Heaven, or still upon it: or be behind or before it. 4. When the Fortunes and Infortunes shall be of equal strength; at which time thou therefore oughtest not to receive any question. But, in my opinion, there may well be added yet three ways more, wherein the Astrologer will subject to err: 1. When the Querent comes only to try him, or put a trick upon him, as many do, saying, ‘Let us go to such an Astrologer, and ask him such a thing, and see if he can tell us the truth or not.’ Just as the Jews propounded questions to our Lord Jesus Christ, not so much to be resolved, as to tempt and ensnare Him. 2. Wherein the Artist will be liable to err, is when the Querent does not ask out of a serious or settled intention, as some do when they meet an Astrologer by chance or go to him on other business: on a sudden they think of something, and so ask, as it were by-the-bye; wherein ‘tis a thousand to one but mistakes happen. But thou mayest be ready to say, ‘How shall I know whether the Querent come out of a solid intention, or only to try me?’ To which I answer, that it seems a very abstruse and difficult point, perfectly to find out; but this I have often experienced and found true, viz., I observed the hour of the Question, and if the Ascendant then happened very near the end of one sign and beginning of another, so that it seemed as between both; I said they did not ask seriously, or that they came to try me; and I have had many that have thereupon confessed what I said to be true, and began to think that I knew more than before they believed. For in such cases I used to say, ‘Pray, friend, do not trouble me unless you ask seriously, for I suspect that you would put a trick upon me, by not proposing this Question as you ought: however, if you will give me trouble for your pleasure, be pleased to give me likewise satisfaction for my pains’; and immediately, if there were any deceit intended, away they went. Another, viz., a third way whereby an Astrologer may err, is when the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the Hour are not the same, nor of the same Triplicity, or be not of the same Complexion with the Ascendant; for then the Question is not Radical, as I have frequently found by experience. And this I have recited, that thou may’st know for what persons thou should’st undertake to give judgment; for as one says, “The issue of the thing is according to the solicitude of the Querent, and as he comes in necessity, as sad, thoughtful, and hoping that thou art able and knowest how to satisfy him the truth of the matter; and in such cases thou may’st securely venture upon the question.”`},
    {id: 8, quote: `The Eighth Consideration is, To mind how many of the aforesaid manners or points necessary to be used and heeded in giving Judgments thou hast to consider; and they are Thirty, that is to say, sixteen impediments of the Moon, ten of the other Planets; as hath been said, and besides all those the Planets’ several joys, which are four. Of which the first is the House which each Planet does delight in, as Mercury in the Ascendant, the Moon in the Third, Venus in the fifth, Mars in the sixth, the Sun in the ninth, Jupiter in the eleventh, Saturn in the Twelfth. The second is, when a Planet is in a sign he delights in, as Saturn in Aquarius, Jupiter in Sagittary, Mars in Scorpio, Sol in Leo, Venus in Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, and the Moon in Cancer. The third is when Diurnal Planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Sol, and Mercury, are in Diurnal Houses in the East and Oriental of the Sun near the Horoscope; and the Nocturnal Planets, as Mars, Venus, Luna and Mercury, are in Nocturnal Houses in the West and Occidental of the Sun; especially near the cusp of the seventh. The fourth is when the three Superiors, Saturn, Jupiter or Mars, are in Masculine Quarters; which are counted from the cusp of the Tenth House to the cusp of the Ascendant, and from the cusp of the fourth House to the cusp of the seventh House; and when the Feminines, viz., Venus or the Moon are in Feminine Quarters, which are from the cusp of the Ascendant to the cusp of the fourth House and from the cusp of the seventh to the cusp of the tenth. As for Mercury, he delights when with Masculine Planets in Masculine Quarters, but with Feminine Planets in Feminine.`},
    {id: 9, quote: `The Ninth Consideration is, To take notice of the several ways, as well secret as manifest, good and evil, whereby things are helped or hindered to be done or not done, and of these there are one and twenty in number. 1. A most strong secret helper. 2. A very strong secret Helper. 3. A strong secret helper. 4. A weak secret Helper. 5. A weak secret Helper. 6. A most weak secret Helper. 7. A most strong manifest Helper. 8. A very strong manifest Helper. 9. A strong manifest Helper. 10. A weak manifest Helper. 11. A weaker manifest Helper. 12. A most weak manifest Helper. 13. A most strong secret Hinderer. I4. A very strong secret Hinderer. 15. A strong secret Hinderer. 16. A weak secret Hinderer. 17. A weaker secret Hinderer. 18. A most weak secret Hinderer. 19. A most strong manifest Hinderer. 20. A very strong manifest Hinderer; and 21. A strong manifest Hinderer. All which we shall treat particularly, the same being a secret of secrets. In the judicial part of Astrology which the ancients did not regard, nor have said anything plainly of it that I find, save only that ‘Haly’ seems to have touched a little upon it in his Exposition of the 23rd of Ptolemy’s Centiloquium; nor do I believe they omitted those things out of ignorance, but rather through disuse or fear of being too tedious, or burdening the minds of their Readers or Auditors: For they were wont to judge, according as they found the Planets disposed in Houses and Signs, their Fortitudes and Debilities, together with the Part of Fortune, and some few other things. But thou oughtest to consider in thy judgments, not only what they did, but also all other circumstances that thou canst; for when thou dost erect a figure, thou should’st first find the Significator of the thing enquired after, or to be undertaken, and see if any of the fixed stars of his own Nature be in either of his Houses, or in his Exaltation, or in conjunction with him to a minute; for then such star shall so far help the significator, that the thing shall be accomplished and effected, even beyond the Querent’s hopes, and this is a most strong secret Helper: For the Querent may well wonder how it comes to pass. Now, if the same star should be in the same degree with the Significator from one minute to 15’ before him or 5’ behind him, it will still help him, but not so much: and this we call a very strong secret Helper; but if it be with him in the same degree, but above 16 minutes distance and within 50’, it will somewhat help, yet this less; and this we call in the Positive degree only a strong secret Helper. If it be in the same degree with the Significator, in a place where he has two of his smaller Dignities, in the very same minute, or within 16 minutes, it will help him yet less, and then ‘tis a weak secret Helper; from 16’ to 50’ still less, and then ‘tis a weaker secret Helper; but if it be with the Significator in a place where he has no dignities at all it will still help, but as it were insensibly; and this we call a most weak secret helper. The like we may say on the contrary of those things that prejudice, frustrate, and hinder business: For if a Planet which is Significator of anything, being in a place where he has not any Dignities, shall be joined with one of the Fixed Stars of a contrary nature, it will weaken him and not suffer the thing to come to pass; although otherwise by the Figure it seemed never so probable; so that, for want of heeding this, the Artist often gets discredit, and raises a scandal on the Art itself amongst the ignorant: and this is a most strong secret Hinderer; whereas if the same Star be remote above 16 minutes from the Significator, it will weaken him, but not altogether so much; whence it may be called only a very strong secret Hinderer. And so downwards through all degrees in the same manner as we said of the Helpers or Assistant Causes respectively <br>Of the several 21 Modes aforesaid, which are most strong Helpers, &c. and which strongest obstructs<br> The several Modes before mentioned are thus to be known and distinguished: A most strong manifest Helper or Adjuvant cause, is when the Planet which is Significator of a thing, is in his own House; in an Angle on the very minute of the cusp, direct, swift of course, in reception, and free from all affliction and impediment; which most seldom happens.<br>A very strong manifest Helper, is when the Significator is in his House or Exaltation in an Angle within a degree or two of the Cusp, free from impediment, and in Reception, which very seldom happens. <br>A strong manifest Helper, is when the Significator is in an Angle in his House or Exaltation, within 3 degrees before the Cusp, or 5 degrees after it. <br>A weak manifest Helper, is where a Planet is in two of his lesser Dignities in an Angle within 5 degrees before or 15 degrees after it; or is in his House, or Exaltation, in a succedent House free from affliction.<br>A weaker open Helper, is when the Significator is in his own House or Exaltation, or two of his lesser Dignities, but in a cadent House of the Figure, yet beholding the Ascendant. <br>A most weak open Helper is when the Significator is in some of his greater Dignities, or two of his lesser, not beholding the Ascendant; or in one of his lesser Dignities; only beholding the same, or joined to a Planet that beholds the same, and has some Dignities therein. <br>A most strong open Hinderer is when the Significator is in a place where he hath no Dignity, no delight, is not received; besieged by the Two Infortunes, Cadent from an Angle, and from the Ascendant: and so much the worse if joined with any of the Fixed Stars, of a mischievous nature, &c. <br> There may be other both adjuvant and obstructing causes, besides what we have mentioned, both open and secret; proceeding from the conjunctions of Planets and their Aspects, too tedious here to discourse of. Nor shall I here enlarge on all those before mentioned, but most assure thee that this ninth consideration, carefully observed, will be of great use in raising a true and wary judgment; especially if thou hast always a diligent eye to the Moon; for she of all the Planets has the greatest similitude and correspondence with inferior things, both in general and particular: as well the species of the kinds as the individuals of the species; with winds; to pass by her daily effects which she causes in all things here, and frequent revolutions about the Elements and Elementary Bodies by reason of the nearness of her Orb to the Earth, and smaller circle than any other Planet; so that she seems a Mediatrix between Superior and Inferior Bodies.<br> And as we see that in the New Moon she appears small, thin, and little, but afterwards her light gradually increases, till all that part of her body towards us becomes replenished with lustre: and then again it decays by insensible degrees till she totally disappears: just so do all bodies both of things Rational, Irrational, and Vegetative: as men grow until they are completed to their determinate stature, and then droop and decline continually till their life is ended; and so of all other things. Hence tis necessary to make the Moon concerned in the Signification of every Question, Nativity, Enterprise and Business, and her good condition to show the good issue of the thing: and so on the contrary. For her Virtue and Power is such and so great, that if the Lord of the Ascendant or other Significator of a business be so weak and afflicted that he cannot bring it about and complete it as he ought: if she be but strong it shall, notwithstanding, be accomplished. For she is the School-mistress of all things; the Bringer-down of all the Planets’ influences, and a kind of an ‘internuncio’ between them, carrying their virtues from one to the other, by receiving the disposition of one planet and bearing it to another. And some have thought that she does this at all times, of which opinion was that Tyrant Cylinus de Romano, viz., That when she separates from one Planet, she takes the virtue and carries it to another, committing the same to the first that she can meet with. And some have imagined that “Zael” said the same; but his meaning was not absolutely so; for he believed That the Moon did bear what was committed to her; but if it were not so given or committed to her she could not carry anything to any; to which I assent: for when the Moon is joined to any planet that receives her, then that planet commits its disposition to her, who carries it with her and bestows it on that planet whom she first meets with in any of her dignities, and not to another: according to that Aphorism, — “A Planet gives nothing in a place, where he has promised nothing.”`},
    {id: 10, quote: `The Tenth Consideration, Is warily to observe what Fixed Stars may either help or hinder the matter in question; for they have oftentimes great power, and lead the Astrologer sometimes into error; and let the Artist be sure to consider the places of the Fixed Stars, as they are in the present age carefully reduced.`},
    {id: 11, quote: `The Eleventh Consideration, Is to take notice of the Malevolent Planets, and what they signify; for Saturn and Mars are naturally bad, Saturn for excess of cold, and Mars for excess of heat; not that either of them is really hot or cold, but virtually so; and these are their effects. And so they signify evil and damage and hindrance, unless they receive the Significator or the Moon by House, Exaltation, or two of their smaller dignities; or shall themselves be Significators; for then they will bridle in their malice, and not weaken or hinder him whom they receive, with what aspect soever they behold him; but if they do not receive, their malice is increased; and so much the more if they be in Opposition or Square; for in Sextile or Trine the mischief is less. Yet ‘Zael’ seems to say that Infortunes lay aside or restrain their malice, where they are in Trine or Sextile; but his meaning was only that they were not then so violent, and intended not that their malice was wholly abated.`},
    {id: 12, quote: `The Twelfth Consideration, Is to behold the Fortunes, and see what they signify; for Jupiter and Venus are Fortunes by Nature, and being temperate, are said to be without any malice, because they do hurt to none, unless now and then by accident; which is beside their intention and very seldom for they make their impression temperately and profitably, and always endeavour to help both their own and others, whether they receive them or not; but so much the better if they receive them; and their Trine or Sextile is better and more advantageous than their Square, and their square than their Oppositions.`},
    {id: 13, quote: `The Thirteenth Consideration, is to regard the Sun and his Significators, for he is also called a fortune, and so, whatever aspect he shall be beheld by, unless it be Opposition; but by Conjunction he becomes an Infortune, because then he renders every star that is so in Conjunction with him, combust and unfortunate; unless the same shall be in the heart of the Sun, and there every star is fortified.`},
    {id: 14, quote: `The Fourteenth Consideration is to mind Mercury and the Moon, and what Planets they are joined with; because they will have the signification with those with whom they are so joined; being of a convertible nature.`},
    {id: 15, quote: `The Fifteenth Consideration, is to regard the several ways in general whereby Planets make impressions on these inferior things, which are two, one good and the other bad; for the Fortunes have power of imprinting good naturally, and the Infortunes as naturally shower down ill impressions; whence thou mayest, wherever thou seest the Fortunes, hope for good; and when thou beholdest the Malevolents, fear mischief, unless the same be restrained as aforesaid.`},
    {id: 16, quote: `The Sixteenth Consideration is to take notice whether the Planet that is Significator of anything, be afflicted by either of the Malevolents; which is when one of them casts his rays upon the rays of such Significators, according to the quantity of their Orbs; And Whilst he so continues with his rays or light under those of the Malevolent, such Significator is said to be impedited, hindered or afflicted, till the Malevolent have passed him; and ‘Zael’ says, “After the ill Planet has passed the Planet he did afflict, one whole degree, the Planet shall be said to be freed of him.”** But I rather think that after the Malevolent is passed him one minute, he may be said to be free and excepted; ** for afterwards he can only frighten him. True it is he raises a greater fear when he is passed him only one minute, than when he is gone by a whole degree; but yet even then it is such a kind of fear as is not altogether without some glimmering of hope. As thus, One intending to go into a Battle, inquires whether he shall return from thence safe and sound or not? And the Ascendant is Gemini 13 degrees, and Mercury in the 7th degree and 54 min. of Aquary, in the 9th joined with Saturn, who is likewise in 7 degrees 53 minutes of Aquary, so that Mercury is now separated from Saturn, who was Lord of the House of Death, one minute; whence it appears that he should have died in that engagement by reason of the Conjunction, and was in peril of death and a kind of desperate fear that he should be slain by his enemies and shall be pursued by them so that shall seem not able to escape, and they shall often lay hands on him, but at last he shall get away from them and make his escape; even beyond his own hopes; and all because Mercury is separated from Saturn; and ‘Zael” saith, “That if a Malevolent planet that would hinder any business be cadent from the Ascendant so that he cannot behold it, he cannot really hinder the matters; but only puts the persons concerned into terrors and frights about it.”`},
    {id: 17, quote: `The Seventeenth Consideration, is to view whether the Planet that is Significator, be safe and prosperous, that is free from any affliction from the Infortunes; and one of the Fortunes casts his beams or light on the beams of such Significator; for then shall that Planet be said to be safe and guarded till the Fortune is passed by the space of one minute, and signifies the perfection of the thing. But after he has passed him one minute, it will not be perfected or accomplished; for it only raises hopes; as (we said) the Malevolent in the like case could do nothing, but create fear. Yet is such a hope as the Querent will believe and fancy himself as it were certain; yet not without something of doubt: as for example, A Question is proposed of some weighty and difficult business, whether it will be done and brought to pass or not? And 17 degrees of Scorpio Ascends, and Mars is 12 degrees 13 minutes of Taurus, and Venus in 12 degrees and 14 minutes of Capricorn, so that Venus is joined to Mars by a Trine, and receives him in her House, who likewise receives her in his Exaltation; so that the Querent thinks, and all others concerned verily believe, that it would be accomplished by that aspect of perfect friendship; in which flattering hopes they continue till Venus hath passed the Aspect of Mars one whole degree; but at last the business comes to just nothing at all, because Venus was past Mars one minute at the time of the question proposed: Yet may a thing possibly in such a case be brought to pass, but not without extraordinary labour and trouble. And here likewise ‘Zael’ affirms, “That if the Fortune be cadent from the Ascendant, so that it cannot behold the same, it only flatters with splendid hopes, but never completes the business.” `},
    {id: 18, quote: `The Eighteenth Consideration, Is to take notice when a planet is in the Angles of the Infortunes, for unless these receive him there, he shall be said to be in an ill condition, and in straits and troubles; as a man on whom some have made an assault; who has many to combat with and none to assist and take his part; or like one that strives against the stream, or falls into a deep pool, and knows not how to swim; and yet by thrusting out his hands and feet, may obtain the bank and escape; though this seldom happens. Now a planet is said to be in the Angles of a Malevolent, when the Malevolent or Infortune, viz., Saturn or Mars, is in one sign, and the other Planet in the fourth, seventh or tenth from him: as if Mars be in Aries, and Mercury in Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn, he is said to be in his Angles: understand the like of their Corporal Conjunction. But if there be Reception, he does not afflict; for reception abates all malice, as we have said elsewhere.`},
    {id: 19, quote: `The Nineteenth Consideration is, To behold the Moon if she be ‘void of course,’ for then it signifies an impediment to the thing in question, it will not come to a good end, nor be accomplished; but the Querent shall be forced to desist with shame and loss.`},
    {id: 20, quote: `The Twentieth Consideration is, To observe whether the Moon or Significator be joined to any of the Planets, for thence you must derive your judgment of what is like to happen in business. Take notice therefore whether the planet to which the Moon or Significator joins, receives them; for then there will be good laudable end; and the matter will be accomplished with success, if the receiver be a Fortune. But if there be no reception, yet if the Moon or Significator shall give virtue to that planet, the thing will still come to pass. But if it be an Infortune, though they do not give him virtue, yet without a reception it will not do; but with a reception, if he be not afflicted, it signifies a good end of the matter, though not without much labour and tediousness.`},
    {id: 21, quote: `The Twenty-first Consideration is, To see from what planet the Moon separates: for that signifies what is past of the business: as from a Fortune the good, from an Infortune the ill that hath been.`},
    {id: 22, quote: `The Twenty-second Consideration is, To note which of the planets the Moon is now joined to, for that signifies what is now present; and from thence we must judge of the present state of the matter.`},
    {id: 23, quote: `The Twenty-third Consideration is, To behold to whom the Moon is now joining [or by applying Aspect], so as her Conjunction is not yet completed: for that signifies what is to come: wherefore if thou wouldst judge of a thing, which as yet is not, but ‘tis hoped will hereafter be brought to pass, ‘tis necessary then thou shouldst see to whom the Moon will next join; and according to her Significations judge whether good or evil.`},
    {id: 24, quote: `The Twenty-fourth Consideration is, To note whether the planet who is Significator be in his Declension, for then it causes a hindrance to everything thereby signified, and trouble and grief about it; and if the Question be about a prison wherein the Querent fears he shall be put, it signifies he shall be cast into the same together with disgrace and prejudice; and if the Question concerns one already in prison, it signifies a tedious confinement and more affliction than he believes.`},
    {id: 25, quote: `The Twenty Fifth Consideration is, Whether the Planet that is Significator be Retrograde, or Stationary to Retrogradation: for then it signifies mischief and damage, discord, contradiction, and going backward with damage; yet being stationary, is not so bad, as being Retrograde. For the last notes the mischief to be, as it were, present and in being. But being Stationary notes that ‘tis past and over.`},
    {id: 26, quote: `The Twenty Sixth Consideration is, Whether the Significator be in his Second Station, that is towards Direction; for that signifies also hinderance and evil, which already hath been and is past; yet some say that this Second Station is as good as direction: but this is only a way of speaking, as when one hath been sick and begins to grow well, we say he is recovered and sound, which is not simply true, but somewhere near it; for as the First Station is not so bad as Retrogradation, so the Second Station is not so good as direction.`},
    {id: 27, quote: `The Twenty Seventh Consideration is, Whether the Infortunes are the Significators of anything; for if they signify ill, the evil will be much augmented, and if good it will be much diminished, abated, imperfect, and with difficulty; so that the party will scarce think his business done, unless by chance they be in a very good condition and excellently disposed.`},
    {id: 28, quote: `The 28th Consideration is, Whether the Significator be slow of Course, for then it delays the effect; and if it be in the beginning of anything, retards it, so that it will be scarce ever be finished: besides, things proceed slowly, where Significators are pointed in Sagittary, Capricorn, Aquary or Pisces: or who are the Lords of them, whether they be slow of course; in Aries or Scorpio they are not quite so dilatory. In Leo they hasten business; more in Taurus or Libra; but most of all in Gemini or Virgo.`},
    {id: 29, quote: `The 29th Consideration is, Whether the Moon be joined to any planet by body or aspect exactly to a minute; for that signifies the present state of things; and from that minute observe what planet she joins next, for he shall be Significator of all that shall happen of that thing; as the planet she was last before with, was of what has already passed as aforesaid.`}
